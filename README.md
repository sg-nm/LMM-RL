OpenRLHF is a high-performance RLHF framework built on Ray, DeepSpeed and HF Transformers:

- **Simple and easy to use**: OpenRLHF is one of the simplest high-performance RLHF libraries currently available, enabling 34B model RLHF training with just a single DGXA100 node (see the training [script](./examples/scripts/train_ppo_llama_ray_34b.sh)).
- **Distributed RLHF**: The key idea behind OpenRLHF is to distribute the Actor, Reward, Reference, and Critic models onto separate GPUs using Ray, while placing the Adam optimizer on the CPU. This enables full-scale fine-tuning of 7B models across multiple 24GB RTX 4090 GPUs (or 70B+ models with multiple A100 80G GPUs and vLLM).
- **High performance**: Thanks to the ability to use a large inference batch size with Ray and DeepSpeed's CPUAdam (Pinned Memory), the performance of OpenRLHF with the 13B LLaMA2 model is 4x that of DeepSpeedChat. We also support vLLM generation acceleration to further improve the performance.
- **PPO Implementation Tricks**: We integrated the implementation tricks for PPO to improve the training stability, referencing https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12729 and https://iclr-blog-track.github.io/2022/03/25/ppo-implementation-details/.

## Features

- Distributed [PPO based on Ray](./examples/scripts/train_ppo_llama_ray.sh). 
- Support full RLHF fine-tuning of models with [over 70 billion parameters](./examples/scripts/train_ppo_llama_ray_70b.sh).
- Support vLLM generation acceleration in RLHF (--vllm_num_engines).
- Support multiple reward models.
- Support [DPO (direct-preference-optimization)/IPO/cDPO](./examples/scripts/train_dpo_llama.sh).
- Support [KTO](./examples/scripts/train_kto_llama.sh).
- Support [Rejection Sampling](./examples/scripts/train_rejection_sampling_llama.sh).
- Support [Conditional SFT](./examples/scripts/train_conditional_llama.sh) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12050).
- Support [Mixtral 8*7b](./examples/test_scripts/train_sft_mixtral_lora.sh) (--aux_loss_coef)
- Support Wandb log (--wandb).
- Support FlashAttention2 (--flash_attn).
- Support QLoRA (--load_in_4bit), LoRA (--lora_rank, --target_modules).
- Multi-nodes [training scripts](./examples/scripts/train_llama_slurm.sh) for Slurm.
- Pre-trained LLaMA2 [checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/OpenLLMAI)


**TODO** 
- Allows saving and loading training checkpoints.
- Support Hybrid vLLM inference engine.
- Support Multi-adapters(i.e, shared base model) RLHF

## Performance

|        | 7B llama2 RLHF | 13B llama2 RLHF (50k samples) | 
|  ----  | ----  |  ----  |
| OpenRLHF  | - | 17 hours with 8 A100  | 
| DeepSpeedChat  | - | 48 hours with 16 A100  |

**Configs for Ray and DeepSpeed:** 

- 4 A100 80G for Actor, 2 A100 80G for Critic, 1 A100 80G for RM, and 1 A100 80G for InitPolicy
- ZeRO2 with Adam Offload
- Max Sequence Length: 2048 

**Throughput:**

- 7B llama2: 0.136 samples/gpu/secs
  - micro_batch_size = 16/8 (rollout/train), generation_length = 100~300
- 13B llama2: 0.05 samples/gpu/secs
  - micro_batch_size = 8/4 (rollout/train), generation_length = 200~400
- 34B codellama: 0.009 samples/gpu/secs
  - micro_batch_size = 2/1 (rollout/train), generation_length = 300~800

samples/gpu/secs = Number of PPO Samples / Number of A100 GPUS / Seconds

## Running Example

You can build openrlhf from **nvidia-docker(recommended)** or from conda envs.

```shell
Clone the repository: 
git clone https://github.com/openllmai/OpenRLHF.git
```

* Single-node training with nvidia-docker

```shell
cd examples/scripts

# install nvidia-docker (Optional)
./nvidia_docker_install.sh

# launch nvidia container
./docker_run.sh

# cd in container
cd /openrlhf/examples/scripts

# build OpenRLHF (i.e, pip install)
./build_openrlhf.sh

# huggingface login 
~/.local/bin/huggingface-cli login

# continue pretrain
./train_continue_pretrain_llama.sh

# train SFT model
./train_sft_llama.sh

# train RM model
./train_rm_llama.sh

# train PPO model
./train_ppo_llama.sh

# train DPO model
./train_dpo_llama.sh

# train KTO model
./train_kto_llama.sh

# train Rejection Sampling model
./train_rejection_sampling_llama.sh

# train Conditional SFT model
./train_conditional_llama.sh
```

* PPO training with Ray
> for > 13B models on V100/A100/H100.. or 7B models on RTX4090

```shell
cd examples/scripts

# launch nvidia container
./docker_run.sh

# cd in container
cd /openrlhf/examples/scripts

# build OpenRLHF (i.e, pip install)
./build_openrlhf.sh

# huggingface login 
~/.local/bin/huggingface-cli login

# launch ray in container
nohup ray start --head --node-ip-address 0.0.0.0 --num-gpus 8 --block &> ray.log &

# if you want to launch ray on more nodes, use
# ray start --address {MASTER-NODE-ADDRESS}:6379  --num-gpus 8 --block

# train ray PPO model, requires 8 gpus in default config
./train_ppo_llama_ray.sh
```

* Multi-nodes training on Slurm

```shell
cd examples/scripts

# huggingface login on Slurm 
pip install transformers
huggingface-cli login

# Moidfy the Slurm Account/Nodes ... in `train_llama_slurm.sh`

# For SFT, RM, and PPO and DPO training:
# Modify the variable `training_script` in `train_llama_slurm.sh` to
readonly training_script="train_sft_llama.sh"
readonly training_script="train_rm_llama.sh"
readonly training_script="train_ppo_llama.sh"
readonly training_script="train_dpo_llama.sh"

# set `GPUS_PER_NODE` in `train_llama_slurm.sh`
readonly GPUS_PER_NODE=8

# run multi-nodes training script
# train_llama_slurm.sh will load the training args from `training_script`
sbatch ./train_llama_slurm.sh
```

* Inference and Evaluation

After completing the training, you can evaluate your model by using the `inference` script:

```shell
# interactive_chat
./interactive_chat_llama.sh { pretrain_model_path }

# batch generate
python examples/batch_inference.py {args}
```

* build openrlhf from conda envs 

If you really don't want to use nvidia-docker, we also provide tutorials for building openrlhf from a conda environment. (We prefer nvidia-docker to avoid errors caused by the environment.)
```shell
# we need conda
conda create -n openrlhf python=3.10
# so, we need install some package manually: when installing torch, you may need to match the corresponding cuda version.
pip install packaging ninja
pip3 install torch
# check ninjia
ninja --version
echo $? # output: 0
# install flash-attn: may take some time.
# For network error: you can download specified version from https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases.
pip install flash-attn==2.4.2
./build_openrlhf.sh
# enjoy it!
```
